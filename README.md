### HTML Files

**index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for the application.
- It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display the information related to airplane crashes in the Andes mountains.
- It will include a form to allow users to input search criteria, such as date range or location, to filter the crash data.

**crash_details.html**
- This HTML file will display detailed information about a specific airplane crash when a user clicks on a crash from the list on the index page.
- It will include information such as the date, location, airline, flight number, aircraft type, number of fatalities, and a brief description of the crash.

### Routes

**@app.route('/')**
- This route will handle the main page of the application, displaying the list of airplane crashes in the Andes mountains.
- It will query the database to retrieve the crash data and pass it to the index.html template for rendering.

**@app.route('/crash_details/<crash_id>')**
- This route will handle displaying the detailed information about a specific airplane crash.
- It will accept the crash ID as a parameter and use it to query the database for the corresponding crash data.
- It will then pass the retrieved data to the crash_details.html template for rendering.

**@app.route('/search')**
- This route will handle the search functionality of the application.
- It will accept the search criteria from the user (e.g., date range, location) and use it to query the database for the filtered crash data.
- It will then pass the filtered data to the index.html template for rendering.

### Additional Considerations

- The application will require a database to store the airplane crash data. The specific database technology (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) can be chosen based on the project's requirements and preferences.
- The application will need to implement appropriate data validation and error handling to ensure that user input is valid and the application responds gracefully to unexpected situations.
- The application can be further enhanced by adding features such as user authentication, data visualization, and the ability to export crash data in different formats.
